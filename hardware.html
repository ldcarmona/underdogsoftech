  <h2>8 steps to creating your Perfect build</h2>
  <p>
  - Figure out what's your budget, and what you need this computer for. <br>
  - Gather information about the components you need, make sure they are compatible. <br>
  Good websites that sell PC parts are; Newegg, Tigerdirect, Micro Center. <br>
  - Once you have gathered all your components, start connecting them. Install your CPU first, then the RAM, then the GPU if you have one. <br>
  After you have connected all of the components together on the motherboard, place the motherboard inside the case. <br>
  - The last component you need to install is the power supply, when installed turn on the hardware and make sure all the components are functioning. <br>
  - Once you notice all components are running correctly, for example some good signs are fans spinning, LEDs turning on and so on. <br>
  - The final part is selecting which Operating System you will install.
